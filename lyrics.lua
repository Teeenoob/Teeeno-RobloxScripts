[00:22.08]To the coffin
[00:24.68]To the tiles
[00:27.13]Waiting 'till the afterlife
[00:32.85]My confession won't suffice
[00:38.28]There is too much life left in your eyes
[00:46.87]I know, you know you never betray the truth
[00:50.38]Too soon
[00:52.24]The walls they could say
[00:53.56]" You're just another saint"
[00:58.24]Try to understand
[01:03.28]You are just a man
[01:08.88]The cracks on the pavement, just another sign
[01:14.36]This roof will collapse to kill us both inside
[01:28.30]The bride and groom are laid to rest
[01:30.97]Can I predict what's next?
[01:33.59]The corridor halls of emptiness
[01:36.31]Are looking for a guest
[01:39.15]Sitting in silence I know what we both see
[01:44.86]I know, I know the end is approaching for you and me
[01:53.33]Try to understand
[01:58.80]You are just a man
[02:04.26]"Promises that won't satisfy"
[02:09.78]What are you saying?
[02:13.36]I can't take it anymore
[02:18.07]You're the one who I adore
[02:23.57]Wishing I could've been there to save you
[02:29.13]I know, I know that if I kiss you it might-
[02:33.17]Just burn us alive
